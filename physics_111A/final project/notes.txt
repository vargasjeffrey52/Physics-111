So currently the project project works as follows (if i understand it correctly):
we specify frequencies using 555 timers and capacitors and resistors
we then connect each LED's to the output of these 555 timers. 
Finally we read out the frequencies thorugh a photo diode and dislplay
using labview...

I suggest that instead instead of keeping the frequency fixed at a specified
value we allow it to vary at a specified range of frequncies.
we might be able to do this using a photo resistor.
(photo resistor: the resistance varies with light intensity).

For example using the 555 timer frequnecy equation we can specify the following

RED -  1kHz - 1.9kHz
Green -  2kHz - 2.9kHz
Blue - 3Khz - 3.9kHz

we would control the range of frequencies for each color by sending the 555 output
thorugh a band pass filter before sending it out to the LED.

Finally, we Will No Longer analyze a sample color with the photodiode. Instead we
would used the photo resistor and the other canister I have. we will then bounce light from a
colored object direct it towards the photo resistor.
